Intrusion Detection Tool
→This project is a simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that helps detect potential cybersecurity threats using machine learning. It processes network data and predicts whether the traffic is normal or suspicious.

•Features
-Loads and processes network intrusion data.
-Uses a trained machine learning model (model.pkl) for predictions.
-Includes preprocessing files (label_encoders.pkl, scaler.pkl) to prepare input data.
-Can be run using a Python script (app.py) or Jupyter Notebook (Intrusion Detection Tool.ipynb).

•Files
app.py – Main application script
model.pkl – Trained ML model
scaler.pkl & label_encoders.pkl – Preprocessing tools
cybersecurity_intrusion_data.csv – Dataset
